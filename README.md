Xss CTF Challenge 
=========

### Run It

To run this challenge simply navigate to the main directory where "server.js" is located and run the comand: 

```
node server.js
```

### Play it

Do you like cookies? 
Search for a flag of the type "CxTF{...}"
Have fun!


### Change the flag

You can also set up your own flag by passing it as an argument when running "server.js", like this: 

```
node server.js "yourflag"
```

Just make sure you wrap it in quotes if you use special characters in it, because if you don't, well, things might break!
